Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


## Instructions:

Dependencies - Packages which can be downloaded from CRAN

reshape2 
data.table 

* Download the data source file, "UCI HAR Dataset" folder will be created
* Createa a "run_analysis.R" in the parent directory of "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
* Set working directory as " UCI HAR Dataset "* Run the R script "run_analysis.R"
* After execusiotn of all code a file "tidy_Data.txt" will be created on "UCI HAR Dataset" folder

More informaiton about the code is available within the code.
